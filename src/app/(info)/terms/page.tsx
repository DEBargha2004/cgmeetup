              CGMEETUP provides its service to you subject to the following
              terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service"). CGMEETUP may also
              offer other services that are governed separately by their own
              Terms of Service.

              CGMEETUP provides a collection of content, resources, tools, and
              technologies that enable users to enjoy computer graphics and its
              surrounding culture (the “Service”). You understand and agree that
              the Service is provided “AS-IS” and that CGMEETUP does not assume
              any liability for personal information stored through our Service.
              You accept that the Service may include advertisements. CGMEETUP
              reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or
              discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part
              thereof) with or without notice. You agree that CGMEETUP shall not
              be liable to you or to any third party for any modification,
              suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

            <ListHeader>Registration</ListHeader>
            <Paragraph>
              In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that
              you are of legal age to form a binding contract. You also agree
              to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information
              about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form and
              (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it
              true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any
              information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
              or if CGMEETUP has reasonable grounds to suspect that such
              information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
              CGMEETUP has the right to suspend or terminate your account and
              refuse any and all current or future use of the Service. CGMEETUP
              is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users,
              particularly children. For this reason, parents or guardians of
              children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children
              access to the Service must create an account that is maintained by
              a legal guardian of at least 18 years old and monitor the child's
              usage. By allowing a child access to your account, you also give
              your child permission to access all areas of the Service. Please
              remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad
              audience. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your
              responsibility to determine whether any of the Service areas
              and/or Content are appropriate for your child.

            <Paragraph>
              While many portions of the Service do not require registration,
              you may register as a user of CGMEETUP to enjoy greater access or
              privileges. If you choose to register you will receive a username
              and password upon completing the Service's registration process.
              You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the
              password and account and are fully responsible for all activities
              that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a)
              immediately notify CGMEETUP of any unauthorized use of your
              password or account or any other breach of security, and (b)
              ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.
              CGMEETUP cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
              arising from your failure to protect your account. You
              acknowledge, consent and agree that CGMEETUP may access, preserve
              and disclose your account information and Content if required to
              do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access
              preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply
              with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims
              that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond
              to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights,
              property or personal safety of CGMEETUP, its users and the public.

              You acknowledge that CGMEETUP may establish general practices and
              limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation
              the maximum number of days that email messages, message board

              (and the maximum duration for which) you may access the Service in
              a given period of time. You agree that CGMEETUP has no
              responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store
              any images, messages, and other communications or other Content
              maintained or transmitted by the Service. You acknowledge that
              CGMEETUP reserves the right to log off accounts that are inactive
              for an extended period of time. You further acknowledge that
              CGMEETUP reserves the right to modify these general practices and
              limits from time to time.

              You agree that CGMEETUP may, under certain circumstances and
              without prior notice, immediately terminate your CGMEETUP account,
              any associated email address, and access to the Service. Cause for
              such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
              breaches or violations of the TOS or other incorporated agreements
              or guidelines, (b) requests by law enforcement or other government
              agencies, (c) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions),
              (d) discontinuance or material modification to the Service (or any
              part thereof), (e) unexpected technical or security issues or
              problems, (f) extended periods of inactivity, (g) engagement by
              you in fraudulent or illegal activities, and/or (h) nonpayment of
              any fees owed by you in connection with the Services. Termination
              of your CGMEETUP account includes (a) removal of access to all
              offerings within the Service, (b) deletion of your password and
              all related information, files and content associated with or
              inside your account (or any part thereof), and (c) barring of

              terminations for cause shall be made in CGMEETUP’s sole discretion
              and that CGMEETUP shall not be liable to you or any third party
              for any termination of your account, any associated email address,
              or access to the Service.

              music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or
              other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately
              transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom
              such Content originated. This means that you, and not CGMEETUP,
              are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post,
              email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service.
              CGMEETUP does not control the Content posted via the Service and,
              as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of
              such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may
              unintentionally be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent
              or objectionable. Under no circumstances will CGMEETUP be liable
              in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any
              errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any
              kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted,
              emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.
              You acknowledge that CGMEETUP may or may not pre-screen Content,
              but that CGMEETUP and its designees shall have the right (but not
              the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or
              move any Content that is available via the Service. Without
              limiting the foregoing, CGMEETUP and its designees shall have the
              right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise
              objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all
              risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any
              reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such
              Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on
              any Content created by CGMEETUP or submitted to CGMEETUP,
              including without limitation information in CGMEETUP forums and in
              all other parts of the Service. You understand that the Service
              and software embodied within the Service may include security
              components that permit digital materials to be protected, and that
              use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by CGMEETUP
              and/or content providers who provide content to the Service. You
              may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules
              embedded into the Service. Any unauthorized reproduction,
              publication, further distribution or public exhibition of the
              materials provided on the Service, in whole or in part, is
              strictly prohibited. CGMEETUP does not claim ownership of Content
              you submit or make available for inclusion on the Service.
              However, with respect to Content you submit or make available for
              inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Service, you grant
              CGMEETUP the following worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive
              license: that any Content you submit or make available for

              The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you
              and CGMEETUP and governs your use of the Service, superseding any
              prior agreements between you and CGMEETUP with respect to the
              Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and
              conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other
              CGMEETUP services, affiliate services, third-party content or
              third-party software. The TOS and the relationship between you and
              CGMEETUP shall be governed by the laws of the State of California
              without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and CGMEETUP
              agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the
              courts located within the State of California. The failure of
              CGMEETUP to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS
              shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
              provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction
              to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
              should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as
              reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS
              remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any
              statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
              arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be
              filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action
              arose or be forever barred.
